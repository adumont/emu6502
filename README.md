# Emu6502: 6502 Emulator in FORTH

## Introduction

Development Emu6502 started on AlexForth, on 6502, but I rapidly switched to gForth, due the inherent limitations of developping on a 6502 host (64K address space).

I tested 🔎the emulator against Klaus2m5 6502 CPU tests, and after fixing 4 bugs 🪳, I can now proudly say it passes :
- ✅ all 6502 tests 👍
- ✅ all 65C02 tests👍

## Documentation

This is the recording, and slides, of the presentation I gave to the FORTH2020 users meeting on Jan 21st, 2023 about how I implemented Emu6502, a 65C02 emulator written in Forth.
